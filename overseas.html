            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                <p>üìç Suzhou, Shanghai</p>
                <p>(23 Mar 2025 - 29 Mar 2025)</p>

            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                I had the privilege to be one of six students from Ngee Ann Polytechnic to attend the 
                2025 PolyVenture: Inter-Polytechnic Corporate Immersion Programme to China!</p>

            
            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                During this trip, I had the opportunity to visit several companies, including Suzhou 
                Broadcasting System, Trip.com, FriendTimes Inc., CHAGEE and many more. Seeing these companies operate at
                their headquarters gave me a deeper connection of their business strategies and global expansion efforts. </p>
                
            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                An enlightening session I had was the networking event organized by Singapore Chamber of Commerce and 
                Industry in China (SingCham) ‰∏≠ÂõΩÊñ∞Âä†Âù°ÂïÜ‰ºö where I met students interning / studying in China. Hearing 
                their experiences was encouraging and reassuring. It was inspiring to see fellow Singaporean students 
                thriving in a foreign work environment. </p>

            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                One of the most impactful sessions was with the Consulate-General of Singapore in Shanghai. Learning how 
                they supported Singaporeans abroad, especially during the COVID-19 lockdowns, highlighted the importance of 
                diplomatic presence in safeguarding our people overseas. </p>

            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                Beyond corporate insights, I also got a firsthand experience of China‚Äôs highly efficient digital ecosystem,
                where almost every service, whether it‚Äôs cashless payment, transport bookings, or food delivery, can be done
                seamlessly through a single app via WeChat or Alipay. It was truly impressive to see how deeply integrated
                these platforms are, making daily transactions incredibly fast, convenient, and almost second nature to locals. </p>

            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                Grateful to ÈÄöÂïÜ‰∏≠ÂõΩ Business China for this invaluable opportunity and to my amazing team for making 
                this journey unforgettable! </p>

            <h2 id="project-title">Overseas Immersion Program: China</h2>

            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                <p>üìç Shenzhen</p>
                <p>(17 Apr 2024 - 30 Apr 2024)</p>

            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                I had the incredible opportunity to participate in a two-week Overseas Immersion Programme (OIP) in Shenzhen,
                China, as part of a cultural and academic exchange with Shenzhen Polytechnic University.</p>

            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                Throughout the programme, we were warmly welcomed by students from Shenzhen Polytechnic University, who brought 
                us on guided tours around their campus and their city. They introduced us to Shenzhen's rich cultural heritage 
                through visits to historical landmarks such as Dapeng Fortress and Nantou Ancient Town. These outings, paired with 
                bonding activities and shared meals, created meaningful opportunities for cross-cultural exchange and genuine friendships.</p>

             <p id="project-desc"></p>
                A key highlight of the trip was the series of company visits to some of Shenzhen's most influential tech innovators. Shenzhen 
                    is often referred to as China's "Silicon Valley", where it's home to countless cutting-edge companies shaping the future of technology.</p>

             <p id="project-desc"></p>
                During the trip, we visited several innovative companies such as Han's Laser Institute, UBTECH Robotics, and Narwal
                Robotics. One of the most memorable company visits was to Tencent, the tech powerhouse behind WeChat. It was fascinating
                to learn how deeply their technology is embedded into everyday life in China. </p>

            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                Special thanks to Shenzhen Polytechnic University and all the organizing partners for curating such a meaningful and enriching experience! </p>
