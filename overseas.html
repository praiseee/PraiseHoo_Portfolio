            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                üìç Suzhou, Shanghai</p>
                <p>(23 Mar 2025 - 29 Mar 2025)</p>

            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                I had the privilege to be one of six students from Ngee Ann Polytechnic to attend the 
                2025 PolyVenture: Inter-Polytechnic Corporate Immersion Programme to China!</p>

            
            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                During this trip, I had the opportunity to visit several companies, including Suzhou 
                Broadcasting System, Trip.com, FriendTimes Inc., CHAGEE and many more. Seeing these companies operate at
                their headquarters gave me a deeper connection of their business strategies and global expansion efforts. </p>
                
            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                An enlightening session I had was the networking event organized by Singapore Chamber of Commerce and 
                Industry in China (SingCham) ‰∏≠ÂõΩÊñ∞Âä†Âù°ÂïÜ‰ºö where I met students interning / studying in China. Hearing 
                their experiences was encouraging and reassuring. It was inspiring to see fellow Singaporean students 
                thriving in a foreign work environment. </p>

            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                One of the most impactful sessions was with the Consulate-General of Singapore in Shanghai. Learning how 
                they supported Singaporeans abroad, especially during the COVID-19 lockdowns, highlighted the importance of 
                diplomatic presence in safeguarding our people overseas. </p>

            <p id="project-desc"></p>
                Beyond corporate insights, I also got a firsthand experience of China‚Äôs highly efficient digital ecosystem,
                where almost every service, whether it‚Äôs cashless payment, transport bookings, or food delivery, can be done
                seamlessly through a single app via WeChat or Alipay. It was truly impressive to see how deeply integrated
                these platforms are, making daily transactions incredibly fast, convenient, and almost second nature to locals. </p>

                Grateful to ÈÄöÂïÜ‰∏≠ÂõΩ Business China for this invaluable opportunity and to my amazing team for making
